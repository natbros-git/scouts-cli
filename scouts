"""Scouts BSA Internet Advancement CLI entry point.

Development convenience script. When the package is installed via
pip install, the 'scouts' console_scripts entry point is used instead.

This script handles the case where scouts_cli is not on sys.path
(i.e., running directly from the source tree without pip install).
